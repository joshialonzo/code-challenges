Design Patterns

Well-known solutions to common problems in software design.
They are well-accepted solutions by the developer community.

You use design patterns because you don't want to reinvent the wheel.

Types of design patterns:

* Creational:
    * We use these to create objects systematically.
    * The main benefit is the flexibility.
    * It is pretty useful for settings and configurations.
    * OPP: Polymorphism.

* Structural:
    * Establish relationships between software components.
    * Accomplish both functional and non-functional goals.
    * Different goals require different structures.
    * OPP: Inheritance.

* Behavioral:
    * Object interactions.
    * Accomplish both functional and non-functional goals.
    * The focus is defining protocols of communication between objects.
    * OPP: Methods.

OPP: Object Oriented Programming

* Objects:
    * Represents entities in both problem and solution domains.
        * Problem domain: Concept of the real world.
        * Solution domain: Concept of the software.
    * Components representing all the moving parts of your system.
    * Entities interacting with the software.

* Classes:
    * Templates for creating objects to avoid recreating them each time.
    * Classes are the blueprints for objects.

* Attributes:
    * Represents properties of an entity.
    * Captures the state of an entity.

* Methods:
    * Represents the behavior of an entity.
