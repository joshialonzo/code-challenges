Design Patterns

Well-known solutions to common problems in software design.
They are well-accepted solutions by the developer community.

You use design patterns because you don't want to reinvent the wheel.

    * The main benefit is the flexibility.
    * It is pretty useful for settings and configurations.
    * OPP: Polymorphism.

* Structural:
    * Establish relationships between software components.
    * Accomplish both functional and non-functional goals.
    * Different goals require different structures.
    * OPP: Inheritance.

* Behavioral:
    * Object interactions.
    * Accomplish both functional and non-functional goals.
    * The focus is defining protocols of communication between objects.
