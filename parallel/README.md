## Parallel and Concurrent Programming

### Sequential Computing

A single processor executes a program in a sequential manner. The program is broken down into a sequence of discrete instructions that I execute one after another and I can only execute one instruction at any given moment. There is no overlap between them. The speed of a program is limited by the speed of the processor and how fast can execute a series of instructions.
